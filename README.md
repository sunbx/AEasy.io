Then quickly start your aepp development journey. Let's help it out, let's make Aeternity better,Each transaction in AEASY can be directly inquired through the node on the chain, following the principle of openness and transparency of the block chain

####     **AEASY** does the following
- You can call common apis for nodes
- But the implementation of data on the chain
- User center can be provided with OAuth2 authentication to see quick login

### What can the basic API do ?

The basic API can provide some basic queries of the node, and quickly implement the data chain operation, the chain operation will deduct the account 0.1ae as a handling fee, almost no money, if you have the demand for data chain and is free to the user can use this interface is the best choice

- Gets the current block height interface,This interface can be used to obtain the latest block height of ae
- Obtain the specific contents of the specific information on the chain, including address information, and the data on the chain, transfer amount, etc., can use the interface to obtain the data on the chain.
- Gets the month of the account under the corresponding address
- The data is passed into the block link port, and the data below 5000 length can be stored into the block chain. The block chain data can be saved permanently, which only needs to pay 0.0001ae of fuel fee, which is equivalent to no cost ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
